# Account Update Details

This form allows the Servicedesk to update the following fields of an AD account:

- Title
- Department
- Company

These fields are often used in the Address List, email signatures, and other applications linked to AD.

## Business Benefits

Users can update the title, department, or company without direct access to AD. By controlling access to AD, security is improved.
